# hello-world
gotta start somewhere so why not start with hello?

The story goes something like this. I wanted to write a song but the software was broken so I came to file a bug report. I sought a the source to build it with the bug fixes but couldn't get it quite right. Rather than ask more questions I started reading the C++ tutorial at cplusplus.com to understand what I was doing. Oops, just forked that project I was looking at, pesky mouse. Well, that's it, commit changes to process "self." Hello world! It begins.
